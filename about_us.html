Pioneering from the Start
For more than 25 years, the Biosensors International Group (“Biosensors”) has been developing and marketing critical care catheter systems and related devices used during heart surgery and intensive care treatment. Continually striving to be at the forefront of product innovation, with a focus on improving patient outcomes today, we are driving the development of tomorrow’s next generation medical technology.

In the year 2000 we entered the interventional cardiology market and immediately became the first cardiology company to develop and patent their own proprietary limus agent, Biolimus A9™ (BA9™), a highly lipophilic <sub>1</sub> anti-restenotic drug designed for cardiovascular stent technologies.

We were also the first stent company to develop and launch a biodegradable polymer stent with only the abluminal side coated with polymer and drug to reduce systemic exposure <sub>2</sub>.Over the last two-decades Biosensors has become one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of cardiovascular stents globally.
